/*Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named
'Pinnacle Club'. Students of second, third and final year of department
can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the
membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and
last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to
maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly linked list. Store
student PRN and Name. Write functions to:
a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b) Compute total number of members of club
c) Display members
d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.*/
